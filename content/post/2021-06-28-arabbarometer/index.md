*A new version of the retroharmonize R package – which is working with retrospective, ex post harmonization of survey data – was released yesterday after peer-review on CRAN. It allows us to compare opinion polling data from the Arab Barometer with the Eurobarometer and Afrorbarometer. This is the first version that is released in the rOpenGov community, a community of R package developers on open government data analytics and related topics.*


Surveys are the most important data sources in social and economic
statistics – they ask people about their lives, their attitudes and
self-reported actions, or record data from companies and NGOs. Survey
harmonization makes survey data comparable across time and countries. It
is very important, because often we do not know without comparison if an
indicator value is *low* or *high*. If 40% of the people think that
*climate change is a very serious problem*, it does not really tell us
much without knowing what percentage of the people answered this
question similarly a year ago, or in other parts of the world.

With the help of Ahmed Shabani and Yousef Ibrahim, we created a third
case study after the
[Eurobarometer](https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/articles/eurobarometer.html),
and
[Afrobarometer](https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/articles/afrobarometer.html),
about working with the [Arab
Barometer](https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/articles/arabbarometer.html)
harmonized survey data files.

*Ex ante* survey harmonization means that researchers design
questionnaires that are asking the same questions with the same survey
methodology in repeated, distinct times (waves), or across different
countries with carefully harmonized question translations. *Ex post*
harmonizations means that the resulting data has the same variable
names, same variable coding, and can be joined into a tidy data frame
for joint statistical analysis. While seemingly a simple task, it
involves plenty of metadata adjustments, because established survey
programs like Eurobarometer, Afrobarometer or Arab Barometer have
several decades of history, and several decades of coding practices and
file formatting legacy.

-   *Variable harmonization* means that if the same question is called
    in one microdata source `Q108` and the other `eval-parl-elections`
    then we make sure that they get a harmonize and machine readable
    name without spaces and special characters.
-   *Variable label harmonization* means that the same questionnaire
    items get the same numeric coding and same categorical labels.
-   *Missing case harmonization* means that various forms of missingness
    are treated the same way.

In our new [Arab Barometer case
study](https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/articles/arabbarometer.html),
the evaulation of parliamentary elections has the following labels. We
code them consistently `1:  free_and_fair`, `2:  some_minor_problems`,
`3:  some_major_problems` and `4:  not_free`.

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;">“0. missing”</td>

Of course, this harmonization is essential to get clean results like this:

{{< figure src="/img/blogposts_2021/arabb-comparison-country-chart.png" caption="For evaluation or reuse of parliamentary elections dataset get the replication data and the code from the [Zenodo](hhttps://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5034759) open repository." numbered="true" >}}

In our case study, we had three forms of missingness: the respondent
*did not know* the answer, the respondent *did not want* to answer, and
at last, in some cases the *respondent was not asked*, because the
country held no parliamentary elections. While in numerical processing,
all these answers must be left out from calculating averages, for
example, in a more detailed, categorical analysis they represent very
different cases. A high level of refusal to answer may be an indicator
of surpressing democratic opinion forming in itself.

Survey harmonization with many countries entails tens of thousands of
small data management task, which, unless automatically documented,
logged, and created with a reproducible code, is a helplessly
error-prone process. We believe that our open-source software will bring
many new statistical information to the light, which, while legally
open, was never processed due to the large investment needed.

We also started building experimental APIs data is running
[retroharmonize](https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/) regularly.
We will place cultural access and participation data in the [Digital
Music Observatory](https://music.dataobservatory.eu/), climate
awareness, policy support and self-reported mitigation strategies into
the [Green Deal Data
Observatory](https://greendeal.dataobservatory.eu/), and economy and
well-being data into our [Economy Data
Observatory](https://economy.dataobservatory.eu/).

## Further plans

Retrospective survey harmonization is a far more complex task than this
blogpost suggest. Retrospective survey harmonization is a far more complex task than this blogpost suggest, because established survey programs have gathered decades of legacy data in legacy coding schemes and legacy file formats.  Putting the data right, and especially putting the invaluable descriptive and administrative (processing) metadata right is a huge undertaking. We are releasing example codes, datasets and charts for researchers to comapre our harmonized results with theirs, and improve our software. We are releasing example codes, datasets and charts

### Experimental API

We are also experimenting with the automated placement of authoritative
and citeable figures and datasets in open repositories. For the climate
awareness dataset get the country averages and aggregates from
[Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5035562), and the plot in `jpg`
or `png` from [figshare](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.14854359).
Our plan is to release open data in a modern API with rich descriptive
metadata meeting the *Dublin Core* and *DataCite* standards, and further
administrative metadata for correct coding, joining and further
manipulating or data, or for easy import into your database.
