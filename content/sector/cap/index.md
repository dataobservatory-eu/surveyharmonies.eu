[Reprex](/authors/reprex/) grew out of the earlier [CEEMID](/project/ceemid/) project which has 8 years of experience in conducting harmonized cultural access and participation surveys in music, film, and in less detail in numerous cultural and creative sectors and industries (e.g., theatre, dance, arts and galleries, heritage sites, etc.)
