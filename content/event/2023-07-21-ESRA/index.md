ESRA hosts its main conference every two years to bring together applied survey researchers, methodologists and statisticians from Europe and beyond. The conference showcases the latest survey research and offers a number of professional development opportunities, including short courses and awards. It is traditionally hosted in university buildings to keep registration fees to a minimum. ESRA aims to be as inclusive as possible, promoting in particular the participation of doctoral students and early career researchers.

This years' topic is “Survey research in times of crisis: Challenges, opportunities, and new directions”.
