# Big Data Creates Inequalities

Only the largest corporations, best-endowed universities, and rich governments can afford data collection and processing capacities that are large enough to harness the advantages of AI.

# Big data that works for all

Reprex: No matter how big is the problem or how small is your team, we fill your reports, dashboards, newsletters, books with data and its visualization.


---

## Connected financial and sustainability reporting based on open data

Eviota: We map your material impacts in your value chain and connect it with environmental or social data that is re-used from the public sector.


---

## Data problems: Reprex


- <p style="font-size:95%">Most SMEs, and civil society organizations do not have a data scientist/engineer in their team, maybe not even an IT person or a HR professional to make such a hire.</p?

- <p style="font-size:95%">When these organizations must solve novel problems, like connecting their financial accounts with environmental and social impact data or connecting to automated transaction systems (like in music), they need novel solutions that do not require managing a database within their organization.</p>

## Data problems: Eviota


- <p style="font-size:95%">Most SMEs, and civil society organizations do not have a data scientist/engineer in their team, maybe not even an IT person or a HR professional to make such a hire.</p?

- <p style="font-size:95%">To access green bank loans, insurance products, subsidies, or investments, or to keep track of their sustainability goals in line with the Paris Accord or gender equality plan, organizations must connect their accounting system to external environmental data.  We connect their accounts with impact estimates from reliable scientific sources.</p>

## Our solution: Reprex

- <p style="font-size:85%">We create data ecosystems with the modernization of the EU/OECD/UN-endorsed 'data observatory' concept. Our data observatory 3.0 uses the knowledge graphs of the web of data.</p>
- <p style="font-size:85%">We acquire and process data on a scale in our data observatories. We acquire and process data on a scale in our data observatories. Our approach significantly reduces the cost of data acquisition and opens invisible, reliable governmental and scientific data sources. We are currently building five observatories, and one of them is already mature enough to be considered for official EU recognition (serving the music industry).</p>
- <p style="font-size:85%">We provide applications, for example, our Eviota application, which connects financial accounts with environmental and social data, and crates reliable indicators and benchmarks for the requirements of the sustainable finance package. </p>

## Our solution: Eviota (Non-Financial)

- <p style="font-size:80%">We create data ecosystems with the modernization of the EU/OECD/UN-endorsed 'data observatory' concept. Our Green Deal Data Observatory uses the knowledge graphs of the web of data and gives access to reliable, often unseen, hard-to-access ESG data sources.</p>
- <p style="font-size:85%">We acquire and process data on a scale in our data observatories. Our approach significantly reduces the cost of data acquisition and opens invisible, reliable governmental and scientific data sources.</p>
- <p style="font-size:85%">We provide applications, for example, our Eviota application, which connects financial accounts with environmental and social data, and crates reliable indicators and benchmarks for the requirements of the sustainable finance package.  Unlike our competitors, we can serve SMEs, too, at a competitive cost.</p>

## Our solution: Eviota (For Banks)

- <p style="font-size:70%">We create data ecosystems with the modernization of the EU/OECD/UN-endorsed 'data observatory' concept. Our Green Deal Data Observatory uses the knowledge graphs of the web of data and gives access to reliable, often unseen, hard-to-access ESG data sources.</p>
- <p style="font-size:70%">We acquire and process data on a scale in our data observatories. Our approach significantly reduces the cost of data acquisition and opens invisible, reliable governmental and scientific data sources.</p>
- <p style="font-size:70%">We provide applications, for example, our Eviota application, which connects financial accounts with environmental and social data, and crates reliable indicators and benchmarks for the requirements of the sustainable finance package. We are validating our product in the regulatory sandbox of a central bank to show that we provide a cost-effective solution to many regulatory problems opened by the new [sustainable finance package of the EU](https://finance.ec.europa.eu/publications/sustainable-finance-package_en).</p>

## Know-how and integration of open source components

- <p style="font-size:85%">Reprex has a special know-how to map and connect private datasets managing the boundaries of organizations that often have conflicting interests. Our know-how was developed over 10 years, and the data of about 60, often conflicting music industry actors in 12 countries.</p>

- <p style="font-size:85%">Our team has many years of experience with working public sector information reuse, or 'open data', and have built reliable open source software to process legally open, not readily downloadable, and very valuable information that is not available for market vendors.</p>

- <p style="font-size:85%">We use RDF (linked open data) and other technologies to link scattered small data to big data; we use our own R libraries to test and process various data into reliable statistical data or indicators.</p>

- <p style="font-size:85%">Based on our unique data access and software we are developing the Eviota App to connect financial accounts and environmental, social and governance data.</p>

## Data observatories 3.0

<p style="font-size:90%">Reprex is offering shared data ecosystems. Our observatories are great solutions for organizations without a data specialization:</p>

| | 
|:--|
|<p style="font-size:75%">üå≥ Organizations that cannot afford to build a large enough data team to sustain consistent, extensive data collection and processing (many large institutions and companies)</p>|
|<p style="font-size:75%">ü™¥  Who cannot hire even a single data engineer or a data scientist (medium-sized companies, NGOs)</p>|
|<p style="font-size:75%">üå± Who do not even have a permanent IT function (about 2 million European small enterprises and civil society organizations)</p>|

## Target market size

|   <div style="width:400px"></div> |  <div style="width:400px"></div>  |
|:---|:--|
| <p style="font-size:55%">The observatory platforms usually have a build-up cost of about 3-5 million euros and an annual running costs of 0.1-3 million  euros.</p> |<p style="font-size:55%">We hope to gain at least 10% global market share on the observatory platform management market to pay our basic data science team and R&D. </p>
|<p style="font-size:55%"> Our existing observatories give us access to the market and public surveying markets (cc ‚Ç¨ 30-40 bn in the developed nations), particularly to  its software component (‚Ç¨ 10 billion euros). </p> | <p style="font-size:55%">[retroharmonize](https://retroharmonize.dataobservatory.eu/) integrates pre-existing questionnaire-based surveys and new surveys. We see interest from the biggest global players. </p> | 
| <p style="font-size:55%">Our existing observatories gave us access to environmental impact assessment and currently we build an ESG reporting tool with a central bank, a value bank, and a big four company. </p> |<p style="font-size:55%">Connected ESG reporting has a ‚Ç¨4 bn market in the EU alone, and our [Eviota product](https://reprex.nl/apps/eviota/) is very competitive. Due to regulatory pressure, we can harvest a decent share if we are able to attract venture capital. <p/>|

## Traction

| | 
|:--|
|<p style="font-size:75%">üíª Our free scientific software products have a steadily growing user base (several thousand users globally.) </p>|
|<p style="font-size:75%">üìà  We are able to convert this to paying research automation services at a higher growth rate.</p>|
|<p style="font-size:75%">üöÄ  We won four competitive tenders this year, but we feel that the slow tendering/acquisition/cash cycle is hampering our growth, we see far more opportunities that we can serve. Therefore we are looking for investors.</p>|
---

## Funding

| | 
|:--|
|<p style="font-size:75%"> We have a good track record in EU tenders, but we would like to build up this reputation in the Netherlands, too, mainly for new platforms.</p>|
|<p style="font-size:75%">We help our non-profit users, such as cultural heritage organizations, music export offices, collective rights management agencies to get funding to use our platforms and services</p>|
|<p style="font-size:75%">Our for profit-users need a more polished, user-friendlier front-end.  Some are interested in joint ventures (like exploiting our survey capabilities). Venture capital would be preferred, as demand outstrips growth.</p>|

## Pool and take over work where humans fail 

- The cost of questionnaire-based market research (survey) is increasing exponentially and offers mediocre results without an enormous question bank and harmonization with other surveys.
- Manual data acquisition is an error-prone and boring task for humans that requires many working hours (often not credited in consultancies, law firms, or research institutes.)
- Wrangling spreadsheet tables or word processor documents by people without data knowledge is the data Sisyphus.

---

## Open source software and open platform

- Our survey harmonization tool offers hundreds of thousands of answers for your questionnaire item from dozens of countries and many years. We reduce the market research cost while exponentially increasing its value with data harmonization.
- We use automated statistical software or web 3.0 technology to synchronize data automatically with our client's database, dashboard, or spreadsheet.
- Our observatories automate repetitive processing tasks like re-formatting, currency translation, measurement units, documentation, bibliography, and hypertext link management with many computerized 'unit tests.'  We let the computer do the work where humans often make errors or remain hopelessly slow.
---

## Shared evidence ecosystems: data observatories

- Organizations that cannot afford to build a large enough data team to sustain consistent, extensive data collection and processing (many large institutions and companies)
- Who cannot hire even a single data engineer or a data scientist
- Who do not even have a permanent IT function (about 2 million European small enterprises and civil organizations)

## What are data observatories?

- There are more than 60 functional, and about 20 already discontinued data observatories, i.e. long-term, usually triangular (business, academic, policy) data collection institutions recognized by the EU, OECD or UNESCO, including the [European Observatory on Infringements of Intellectual Property Rights](https://single-market-economy.ec.europa.eu/industry/strategy/intellectual-property/enforcement-intellectual-property-rights/european-observatory-infringements-intellectual-property-rights_en#:~:text=The%20European%20Observatory%20on%20Infringements,countries%2C%20businesses%20and%20civil%20society.) of the EU or the [European Audiovisual Observatory](https://www.obs.coe.int/en/web/observatoire) of the Council of Europe.

## Do it Smarter

- They usually do not exchange standard data with statistical agencies, they are not synchronized on knowledge graphs of the Europeana or national libraries, and their research output is usually not to be found on open science repositories.
- The Hague is the winner of the [World Smart City Award 2021](https://thehague.com/businessagency/the-hague-the-winner-world-smart-city-award-2021), and we would like to attract the planned European Music Observatory and other, EU/UNESCO recognized institutions into the town building on the innovations of Reprex and the ecosystem of the Hague.
