If you would like to involved in the business feasibility, we are open to increasing the range of capabilities that our team encompasses, from communications and marketing to human resources, data analysis, and research & development. Feel free to drop us a line and propose your own way of collaborating.*

## Passion For Trustworthy AI, Open Data and Open Source Projects {#open-associate}

- You want to learn to write scientifically valid, open source code in R or Python, but you are a beginner. We help you anywhere - you can even start copyediting or technical documentation (it is a must in open source development) and create tutorials for you to interact with our data and products (if if helps you, it will help others.)

- As a business economist or legal professional, you are interested how open data, open source software, research automation and ethical, trustworthy AI products can find their market. 

- As a blogger, data journalist or marketeer you would like to help to make open data, and transparent, ethical, open AI more widely known and used.
