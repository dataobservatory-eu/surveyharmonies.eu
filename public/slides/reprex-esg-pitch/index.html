## Pool and take over work where humans fail 

- The cost of questionnaire-based market research (survey) is increasing exponentially and offers mediocre results without an enormous question bank and harmonization with other surveys.
- Manual data acquisition is an error-prone and boring task for humans that requires many working hours (often not credited in consultancies, law firms, or research institutes.)
- Wrangling spreadsheet tables or word processor documents by people without data knowledge is the data Sisyphus.

---

## Open source software and open platform

- Our survey harmonization tool offers hundreds of thousands of answers for your questionnaire item from dozens of countries and many years. We reduce the market research cost while exponentially increasing its value with data harmonization.
- We use automated statistical software or web 3.0 technology to synchronize data automatically with our client's database, dashboard, or spreadsheet.
- Our observatories automate repetitive processing tasks like re-formatting, currency translation, measurement units, documentation, bibliography, and hypertext link management with many computerized 'unit tests.'  We let the computer do the work where humans often make errors or remain hopelessly slow.
---

## Shared evidence ecosystems: data observatories

- Organizations that cannot afford to build a large enough data team to sustain consistent, extensive data collection and processing (many large institutions and companies)
- Who cannot hire even a single data engineer or a data scientist
- Who do not even have a permanent IT function (about 2 million European small enterprises and civil organizations)
