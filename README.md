## Welcome üëã 

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Creating an ecosystem of open data and open knowledge sharing in R, hugo, and open science repositories.

üåà Contribution guidelines - you must abide by the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/) Code of Conduct.

This is the website of the [Eviota](https://eviota.eu/). This repository belongs to [Reprex](https://reprex.nl/), a Netherlands-based reproducible research startup.  We created this website, along with many others, using an open source Hugo template. And we create many [open-source software solutions](https://reprex.nl/software/) ourselves.

Our work relies on commissioned work, grants, sponsorship, and the same goes to our friends at [Wowchemy](#wowchemy).  When you use our free products, please give us proper attribution, and if you can, contribute with work or money to keep our products going. 

## New Contributors

Welcome to our [dataobservatory.eu](https://github.com/dataobservatory-eu/) R, hugo, and open data ecosystem and the repository of the [SurveyHarmonies website](https://surveyharmonies.eu/).

## We ask you, humbly, to support this open source movement

Reprex builds open source products, and our friends at Wowchemy do so, too.  You can use Reprex's website, or our observatory websites, such as this one, as a template based on their work.  But we have both worked a lot with it, and therefore, if you use the Wowchemy template, we would like to emphasises the request of the Wowchemy team:

Today we ask you to defend the open source independence of the Wowchemy website builder and themes üêß

We're an open source movement that depends on your support to stay online and thriving, but 99.9% of our creators don't give; they simply look the other way.
